## 2.Definition of three types of apps
### 2.1 native app 
The Chinese name is "native app".Let's take a look at the definition of baidu encyclopedia: third-party applications based on the local operating systems of smart phones, such as iOS, Android and WP, and written and run with native programs. Generally developed languages are Java, C++, etc.The specific expression on the use is that the graph on the desktop is basically a native app.
### 2.2 web app
Still take a look at the definition of baidu encyclopedia: web-based systems and applications running on the web and browser, currently mostly developed using the h5 standard.The specific performance on use is that when the mobile browser is clicked to enter, there will be some small ICONS of the app. After clicking, the page loaded in the browser is the same as the page opened after you directly download an app. These little ICONS represent the web app.
### 2.3 hybrid app
The Chinese name is "mixed app".As the name implies, it is a mixture of native app and web app.A browser is built in the native app, and the appropriate functional pages are rendered in the form of web pages.For example, some marketing pages of jd.com, some news pages of today's headlines, and content pages of tencent news of WeChat.
